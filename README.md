# Algorithm: Gradient descent

Work developed to apply the gradient descent techniques studied during Neural Networks class in the master's degree in Informatics. The work consisted of minimizing the value of the functions using two possible approaches. In the end, some graphics and images in gif format were exported, helping to understand the method. The detailed description of the work is in this repository, in "Trabalho de Redes Neurais.pdf".
