# Algorithm: Gradient descent

Work developed to apply the gradient descent techniques studied during Neural Networks in the master's degree in Informatics. The work consisted of minimizing the value of the functions using two possible approaches. In the end, some graphics and images in gif format are exported, helping to understand the method.
